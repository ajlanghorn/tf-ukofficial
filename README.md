# tf-ukofficial

Terraform code to deploy a UK-OFFICIAL environment on the AWS Cloud, based on the [NCSC](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk) [Cloud Security Principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/implementing-cloud-security-principles) and the [Standardised Architecture for UK-OFFICIAL in the AWS Cloud](https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-reference/enterprise-accelerator/uk/official/latest/doc/standard-uk-official-architecture-on-the-aws-cloud.pdf).

## Prerequisites

The code in this repository has been developed with Terraform 0.10.4 in mind. Whilst it may work with prior and future versions, backwards compatability isn't guaranteed. That said, I do appreciate issues or pull requests should you experience any problems.
